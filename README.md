# Bookshelf
This Bookshelf App I made while practicing for Frontend.
The bookshelf apps works by inputing name of the book and title of the book inside the webpage then store it in a storage space of the browser where it can be retrived when the browser is closed.
Code are in pure JS with CSS for helping HTML styles.
